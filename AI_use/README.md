# How Machines Learn, Where They Struggle, and What Animals Do Differently

## Overview

This repository contains educational materials for a lecture exploring machine learning fundamentals, the limitations of standard deep learning approaches (particularly around uncertainty quantification), and how biological systems learn using principles from the Free Energy Principle.

The materials are designed for teaching and include interactive notebooks, visualizations, and presentation slides.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Understand how neural networks learn through backpropagation and gradient descent
- Recognize the limitations of standard DNNs, particularly overconfidence on out-of-distribution data
- Learn how Bayesian Neural Networks quantify uncertainty
- Explore the Free Energy Principle as a model for biological learning and behavior

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- UV package manager (recommended) or pip
- **System-level Graphviz** (required for neural network architecture visualizations)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SSBM-Lectures
```

2. **Install system-level Graphviz**

   The Python packages `pydot` and `graphviz` (included in dependencies) require the system-level Graphviz executables to generate network architecture diagrams.

   **macOS:**
```bash
   brew install graphviz
```

   **Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
   sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

   **Windows:**
   - Download installer from https://graphviz.org/download/
   - Run the installer and ensure "Add to PATH" is selected
   - Restart your terminal/IDE after installation

   **Verify installation:**
```bash
   dot -V
   # Should output: dot - graphviz version X.X.X
```

   **Note:** If you skip this step, the neural network visualization functions will fall back to text-based summaries instead of generating graphical diagrams.

3. **Run the setup script**
```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
```

   Or manually with UV:
```bash
   # Install UV if needed
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Create virtual environment
   uv venv --python 3.12
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # Install dependencies
   uv pip install -e .

   # Install Jupyter kernel
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name bayesian-nn --display-name "Bayesian NN (Python 3.12)"
```

4. **Launch notebooks**
```bash
   # For the Bayesian NN demo specifically
   ./launch_bayesian_notebook.sh

   # Or open any notebook
   jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

5. **Run the FEP simulation**
```bash
   python free_energy_simulations/fep_agent_simulation.py
```

### Viewing the Slides

The slides are built with Reveal.js and can be viewed locally or deployed to GitHub Pages:

```bash
uv run python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser
```

See `slides/github_pages_setup.md` for deployment instructions.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Standard Deep Neural Networks
- Point estimates for weights
- Deterministic predictions
- Often overconfident on unfamiliar data
- No inherent uncertainty quantification

### Bayesian Neural Networks
- Probability distributions over weights
- Epistemic uncertainty through posterior sampling
- Better calibrated confidence on OOD data
- Natural framework for "knowing what you don't know"

### Free Energy Principle
- Generative models of the environment
- Variational free energy as a bound on surprise
- Perception as minimizing prediction error
- Action as making predictions come true
- Unifying framework for perception, learning, and action

## Expected Learning Outcomes

After working through these materials, students will be able to:

1. **Explain** how gradient descent and backpropagation enable neural network learning
2. **Identify** situations where standard DNNs may fail (OOD data, adversarial examples)
3. **Compare** uncertainty estimates from BNNs vs confidence from standard DNNs
4. **Describe** the Free Energy Principle and its components (generative model, free energy, active inference)
5. **Discuss** how biological systems might implement predictive processing

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| GPU memory errors | Reduce batch size in training functions |
| Slow BNN training | BNNs require multiple forward passes; reduce epochs for demos |
| Import errors | Verify installation with `uv pip list` or `pip list` |
| Slides not loading | Ensure you're serving via HTTP, not opening file directly |
| FEP simulation diverging | Check that numerical stability fixes are applied |
